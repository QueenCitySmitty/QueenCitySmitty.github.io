Hi, welcome to the site!

I'm a software engineer, trying to get a better grasp of concepts in the field. Right now, I'm working as a software engineer at Microsoft.

I graduated with my Bachelors of Science in Electrical Engineering from Clemson University in 2015, and am currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at Georgia Tech online.

Just trying to learn more things and share it with people.
