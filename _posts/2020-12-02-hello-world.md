## Console.log("Hello, world!");
Hello, world! I finally decided to just do it and start a blog.

I've wanted to start writing for a while, and I finally decided to do it. I hyped myself up to the point of wanting to build the entire engine full stack. "I'll learn React, that'll be cool! And I can store everything in a database on the cloud! Awesome!" 

... and then reality set in.  "Wait, what if I want to tag posts? That seems like a requirement for blogs.. and then how do I handle deployments? Normalizing the databases? Rendering everything on a post properly? Do I need to find all these custom renderers...?"

Under the weight of all of this, feeling too anxious to continue, I remembered the golden words of Scott Hanselman: ["There are a finite number of keystrokes left in your hands before you die"](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/do-they-deserve-the-gift-of-your-keystrokes) ([IBM's YouTube video with Scott](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_KtIHEGrmc)).

Is all that worth my time? How long will all of that take? If (lol) there are bugs, I'll be responsible... do I want that burden along with everything else? What else could I do with all that time? How many more posts could I make or how many other projects could I complete with that time?

I finally decided to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which got me running in <b><i>less than a day</i></b> (which might be a post later). Beautiful. Keystrokes: recovered.

Then, the REAL fun began...

## Cool, it works... now what?

Anxiety came back faster than expected. "Okay, now I have to be creative.. what will people care about? What would people read? What are topics I can write about that people might appreciate?

Finally, I decided... whatever. I want to do this so I can extend my learning and make sure I understand topics before I write about them. Do I know everything? Nope, no one does. Can I try to write down my thoughts and maybe someone can learn from them? Sure, why not? Could be interesting.

## Books in the Pipeline

I try to read books that can be technical, so I think it would be interesting and helpful (for me) to write up pieces I've learned from the books I read.

## Wrapping it up
I'll find stuff to write about I guess. I'm excited that everything's up and running. I'm excited Jekyll help me get the site up and running super fast. I'm excited to write my thoughts about some of the books I read or the problems I encounter. It's going to be fun, can't wait.
